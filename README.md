## Prerequisites

## Running the app

Clone the project and setup Docker, Laravel and Lumen on your local machine:

cd search-flights

`npm will also be installed` for you, it's good for
the first time you start the server but afterwards it's preferable
to start it using:

npm run start:prod
```

```npm start```

Run the tests with:
```npm test```
