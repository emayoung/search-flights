===

> Simple Web app and JSON/HTTP api to search for flights.

## Prerequisites

## Running the app

Clone the project and setup Docker, Laravel and Lumen on your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/emayoung/search-flights
cd search-flights
```

`npm will also be installed` for you, it's good for
the first time you start the server but afterwards it's preferable
to start it using:

```
npm run start:prod
```

## Development

To start the server in development mode run:
```npm start```

To Start Docker on your local machine
```
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.
```
$ docker run hello-world
```



Run the tests with:
```
npm test
```
